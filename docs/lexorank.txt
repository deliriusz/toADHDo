okay hi everyone thank you very much for watching this Brownback regarding legs wearing so this basically a brown bag we're getting lecturing and how it works on the back end not up to the details of the formula and how it's being about culprit but I believe sufficient enough to help you guys in handling issue sugar adding like soaring in juror okay well first of all I'm a soir thank you very much for watching I'm from DG Raquel Amir sporting okay so let us start so basically what is luxury in a fool's definition you know what the competition is basically a system for ranking issues in a clustered database agnostic environment using the Lexi Crowe Lexi Koch graphical ordering property of strings even pronouncing it is pretty hard well okay let me make this short and more simple to you guys okay legs drawing is basically is is the thing that responsible to handle the ranking system in JIRA agile mostly use in the agile boards for scrum and Kanban okay in scrum and Kanban backlog you know all right there's a function where users can actually order the issues either if let's say they have greater number of issues and they want that one of those issues to be ranked higher than the other so they can see it easily in the board in the backlog then they can do so so lecture is the one that handles this ordering how to remember all of this ordering that has been set by the user okay so in short basically backdooring is the ranking system using agile boards for both scrum and Kanban in terms of ordering and prioritizing the issues in the backlog okay so I'll show you guys later on the example directly on Jarrah where is it being used so we'll take a look at on that nature so let's continue the current lettering system that we were using is basically a third gen that regen overall the first gen it was using pretty old JIRA I believe in jail for five something it is a very strict fault ranking system we choose numerical value but there's one limitation very big limitation here is basically whenever you want to rebalance the value the rank values okay your system would be locked so it's basically a full bar index something like that so it's pretty tedious and it's not efficient enough so they introduced a new second gen ranking system which each rank held a reference to the rank that came after it so this list was maintained the memory and actual numerical value of the issue is your physician the list so there's no need to lock the system everywhere every time the balancing is need to be done and after that there was some limitation that we found out they need to do some improvement regarding the ranking because that's not enough ranking values because we're using a numerical value and is pretty hard to maintain because it will be limited you can have like up to millions of ranking value we could make the system time slowest so so what we have introduced in the third chain is basically using the lexicographical order of shrink so this is what the difference with a numerical value okay so instead of 100 for example using a basic value it years ay-ay-ay something that you used both numbers as well as letters okay you it use both conviction combination of letters and also numbers so basically the rank value will be something like a 1 2 3 4 sample alright so that's good to the next slide so alright there are three main components that you need to know regarding lecture on ok first is the bucket so bucket is it's basically XS as ice bucket itself it stores the value of the ranking for each of your issues so this bucket there are three bucket exists in here there's only 0 1 &amp; 2 bucket but remember this only one bucket is in use and any given moment there won't be a case where some ranking values are in bucket 1 some ranking values and in bucket 2 answer's no there would be only one bucket in use at one time okay that's the key thing here we'll go through later on more details on this next is the balancing what is balancing balancing is basically we rebalance all the rankings if whenever the rank very is exhausting because for example issues to remove or delete the the rank that it holds previously for this issue will be obsolete so it tends to you you will have you experience ranking to be depleted because of this because of observation has been completed or delete and not very in the port anymore so you need to rebalance the order again everything so is the act of rebalancing all the ranking value up accordingly again ok lastly is the macro where this will hold the value of showing which where's the minimum minimum value in the full rankings in the bucket itself then also it holds the maximum anchor rope which is it holds the maximum value of the ranking in the bucket so there are three type for the marker oh okay as I said just now pops here is the minimum macro in this bucket for example we have buckets zero there will be a pipe zero in this bucket zero you know they will have also type on in this bucket zero that was basically all the ranking values and factory is the maximum macro there will be only one type zero and type two and there will be a large number of pipe one basically all your ranking value so this we will go through in a bit later so to make you guys understand on this more so let's take a look regarding the ranking the most basic so how do you do ranking okay for example we have this this tables we have four issues and of them have this ranking values accordingly AAA BBB CCC and EDD so let's say you want to rank issue three of the issue one you want to move the issue three to issue after issue one okay so basically the ranking will change you because it will have a and an ad D and then BBB D D D so this how the ranking value system works I I hope you guys can understand this because as I said earlier it will be based on alphanumerical so ba BB CC C D D D so if they want to change any values you just sort them out accordingly but this is handle like system there's no need of a manual intervention on this alright it's just some explanation so so when does valency occurs is when it's Austrian of the ranking values occurs as I said earlier if let's say there's normal rank values available for this lecture system it will trigger balancing action automatically you can also trigger the rebalance manually from the management page if let's say there's any any issues on a JIRA you do can trigger this balancing automatic manually sorry so detail on how does this work yes okay let's say I want to rank let us refer to this mr. this they both here let's say on a rank issue one before if you fall so currently the ranking is give me ad DB DC DD D there's no space left between the DC and D DD for me to put issue ID one over here because I will be changing the ranking here but there's no more space so what we are going to do we need to make a space between issue three and four by performing the balancing means we will need to reshuffle all the values here again in order for us to be able to assign issue ID one with a suitable rank that will place him between this two issue okay so what will happen here okay let's take a look here so I've have this shadow alright so let's go back here when there is no more ranking available we will trigger balancing okay when we trigger a balancing we will be using the buckets okay remember the buckets I told earlier okay so as we mentioned earlier as I mentioned earlier only one but they can be used at one okay but when you're performing a rebalancing you'll be using two buckets at one time because you will need to shuffle some of the issues to the other bucket to make space okay so for example let's say we trigger balancing okay what will happen is issue 4 will go to issue 2 bucket 1 because originally it was in bucket 0 it would go to bucket 1 an issue tree as well we go to bucket 1 it will assign a new ranking value to these issues and issue - actually will also eventually go to bucket 1 and if you one also will be going to bucket 1 so what will happen to the new value is it will be having something like this so as we said we won issue 1 to be between issue 24 so basically what happened juror will allocate issue 1 with a new ranking value which is CCD it will sort it out automatically something like this so as you can see when when they moved the new bucket which is bucket 1 only she will be given will be given a new set of ranking values to make space ok so as you can see here now issue 1 can be between in between in 2 3 &amp; 4 okay I hope it is clear to you guys so this is the issue numbers this is the bucket because they already move from the consider to market 1 they are all giving have been given a new set of each ranking ID ok so when a balancing is done it will have a new ranking values as well as then will be able to rank the values again accordingly even though previously they don't have a sufficient space okay so one more thing as well in terms of bucket you can only have like buckets zero go to bucket one look at one go to bucket two bucket to go back to because you're so basically will go to from zero to one one to two and then go back to zero you won't have something like from bucket zero go to bucket two from bucket to go to bucket one back this will cause confusion so the system works is by going from zero to one one two two and two to zero it will be a looping act over here okay so I hope this part is clear so let us see one a few common issues in Jerez so the most common one will be a missing maximum Innokin minimum macro in the database itself okay so how do you do that is basically you run this particular SQL which will show you all the the ranking the custom field where the rank the custom fill where the rank is assigned to so basically in JIRA all these values is stored in a custom field in a custom field called right okay so remember that all the values for the ranking is stored in Jer in the custom field name rang all right so to get that you just run this SQL in your database and then to verify okay to verify if you have the sufficient the correct maximum minimum macro is for you to run this particular SQL where you will display all the values the data of the ranking in July itself so for example here you can see there's three values this example okay so basically you can see here there is zero one - as I see okay this is the pocket number one here is the bucket this is the market rose okay so this is the minimum macro this is the value of the ranking itself as you can see here and this is the maximum macro as you can see here the issue I did for the minimum macro is the most minimum and the maximum and it's basically the ranking ID the ranking for the any issue okay so basically in real life you'll see more of this type 1 there'll be a lot of it and but for type 2 and type 0 they'd only be a single they'll be only one for each field ok so as you can see here it is the few the ID 10500 you can see here ten thousand five hundred only one so what normally happens is this mix is maximum or minimum occurs sometimes to be tend to be missing so what you need to do is you just run an update SQL in your database to insert these missing values it will be pretty straightforward even in the lecture on management tool that we'll be showing an error or something like this okay using macros presentable rank for Phil Phil so these the things that you will need to check so by introducing the missing field here the problem should be able to be fixed out provides in my pitch itself there's already a set of instruction on how you can do this what the command so just refer to that and you should be fine so it's pretty simple like sorry something pretty straightforward it's just the name might be alarming to new engineers but expect basically it's a simple stuff on how a ranking system works so do try this do play around with the database to take a look at the commands that I have given just to see what are those in details what are the commands let's say he just wanna search for the answering fields what are the macros so I have I have certain few number of commands so just refer to them and if you have any further clarification needed feel free to contact one of your local SSC alright so thank you very much for attending this brown bag I'll be seeing you soon take care
